# `%park`

What is a `%park` but a public `%garden`?

`%park` is an unbranded alternative to the [Grid interface](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/master/pkg/grid) for Urbit, privileging customisability and user expressability.

Presently `%park` overwrites your `/` route and just imports your Groups background and sets it as a v0. More to come.

## Installation

Presently deployed on `~sitden-sonnet`.

## Roadmap

Some items listed are prone to experimentation (especially when marked with `?`).

- [ ] Choosing between tiles and a list of applications
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for either
- [ ] Uploading / setting backgrounds within Park
    - [ ] Choosing to import custom themes from other applications
- [ ] Allowing for embedding apps inside an iframe (?)
    - [ ] Tiling applications side-by-side (?)
